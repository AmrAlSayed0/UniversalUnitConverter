# UnitConverterLib (Unit Converter Library)
A Complete Unit Converter Library written in C#

##Status 
This project is still a Work In Progress and is not completed yet. A very high (or arbitrary) precision floating point class is needed to make accurate and precise calculations and conversions so I made a BigDecimal struct (no similar class is available in .NET) based on the BigInteger class provided in the .NET framework.

The BigDecimal struct will be the main focus of this project until it is acceptably complete. The BigDecimal struct is found in /ArbitraryPrecision/. You are free to fork it and make changes to it to improve it.
